# Lecture Notes: Insertion Sort
> "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands." - www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/

## Learning Objectives
* How it works
* Efficiency
* How it differs

## Lecture Flow
* Insertion sort sorts from least to greatest.
    * Insertion sort compares the current value with the one next to it.
* Insertion sort uses loops
    * Uses two loops to go through entire array.
* Insertion sort is inefficient
    * Two loops means there is a time complexity of O(n^2)
