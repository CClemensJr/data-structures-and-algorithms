# Insertion Sorts
> got to sort that data!

## Challenge
> Write a function for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.

## Approach and Efficiency
```
	For this implementation I created two variables, one to track the position in the array
	and the other to track the value being inspected. I then used a for loop to iterate over the array. 
	A while loop was then used to compare each element of the array.

	Time: O(n^2)
	Space: O(n)
```
