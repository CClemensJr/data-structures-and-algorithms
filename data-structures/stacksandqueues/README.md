# Stacks and Queues
> 

## Challenge
> Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure.

## Approach and Efficiency
> For this data structure I used getters and setters to handle creating stacks and queues resulting in a Time efficiency of O(1).

## API
### Stack Methods
#### push()
> This method takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

#### pop()
> This method does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.

#### peek()
> This method does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.

### Queue Methods
#### enqueue()
> This method takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

#### dequeue()
> This method does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.

#### peek()
> This method does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue
