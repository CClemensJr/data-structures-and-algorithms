# Array Binary Search

## Challenge
> Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Example
|Input|	Output|
|-----|-------|
| [2,4,6,7,8], 7 | 3 |
| [4,8,15,23,42], 8 | 1 |
